# ros_build_assistant

ROS build assistant acts as a simple tool to simplify the creation of management and creation of catkin packages.
All you have to do is write source code in python/c++/launch file syntax. The build assistant handles the 
rest of it for you. No more having to write `package.xmls` and editing `cmakefiles`!! Whats more, you will 
automatically get the correct dependencies and the correct build order automatically.
